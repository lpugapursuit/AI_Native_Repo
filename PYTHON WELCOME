# This script asks the user for their name and then prints a personalized greeting.

# 1. Ask the user for their name.
# The 'input()' function displays the text inside the parentheses and then
# waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
# Whatever the user types is then stored in the 'user_name' variable.
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# 2. Print a personalized greeting.
# We use an f-string (formatted string literal) to easily insert the
# 'user_name' into our greeting message.
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the world of Python programming.")

# You can also add another line, like the original "Hello World" if you want!
# print("Hello World!")
